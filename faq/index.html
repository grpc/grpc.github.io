                            <p>gRPC is a modern, open source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems.</p>

                            <p>The gRPC project works in a model where the tip of the master branch is stable at all times. The project (across the various runtimes) targets to ship checkpoint releases every 6 weeks on a best effort basis. If for some reason, a release is skipped by a particular runtime, we may opt to skip that release altogether, and ship the next release, along with the other runtimes and catch up.</p>

                            <p>Yes. gRPC is designed to be extensible to support multiple content types. The initial release contains support for Protobuf and with external support for other content types such as FlatBuffers and Thrift, at varying levels of maturity.</p>

                            <p>gRPC and Protobuf provide an easy way to precisely define a service and auto generate reliable client libraries for iOS, Android and the servers providing the back end. The clients can take advantage of advanced streaming and connection features which help save bandwidth, do more over fewer TCP connections and save CPU usage and battery life.</p>

                            <p>This is largely what gRPC is on the wire. However gRPC is also a set of libraries that will provide higher-level features consistently across platforms that common HTTP libraries typically do not. Examples of such features include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>interaction with flow-control at the application layer</li>

                        <div class="submenu-content">
                            <p>gRPC largely follows HTTP semantics over HTTP/2 but we explicitly allow for full-duplex streaming. We diverge from typical REST conventions as we use static paths for performance reasons during call dispatch as parsing call parameters from paths, query parameters and payload body adds latency and complexity. We have also formalized a set of errors that we believe are more directly applicable to API use cases than the HTTP status codes.</p>
