      <description>gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications and browsers to backend services.
The main usage scenarios:
 Efficiently connecting polyglot services in microservices style architecture Connecting mobile devices, browser clients to backend services Generating efficient client libraries  Core Features that make it awesome:</description>

      <title>gRPC &#43; JSON</title>
      <link>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/grpc-with-json/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you&amp;rsquo;ve bought into this whole RPC thing and want to try it out, but aren&amp;rsquo;t quite sure about Protocol Buffers.  Your existing code encodes your own objects, or perhaps you have code that needs a particular encoding.  What to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, gRPC is encoding agnostic!  You can still get a lot of the benefits of gRPC without using Protobuf.  In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll go through how to make gRPC work with other encodings and types.  Let&amp;rsquo;s try using JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HTTP/2 Smarter At Scale</title>
      <link>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/http2_smarter_at_scale/</link>

      <guid>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/http2_smarter_at_scale/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much of the web today runs on HTTP/1.1. The spec for HTTP/1.1 was published in June of 1999, just shy of 20 years ago. A lot has changed since then, which makes it all the more remarkable that HTTP/1.1 has persisted and flourished for so long. But in some areas it’s beginning to show its age; for the most part, in that the designers weren’t building for the scale at which HTTP/1.1 would be used and the astonishing amount of traffic that it would come to handle. A not-so-bad case is that subsequent tests can&amp;rsquo;t pass because of a leaked resource from the previous test. The worst case is that some subsequent tests pass that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have passed at all if the previously passed test had not leaked a resource.

      <title>Gracefully clean up in gRPC JUnit tests</title>
      <link>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/gracefully_clean_up_in_grpc_junit_tests/</link>

      <guid>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/gracefully_clean_up_in_grpc_junit_tests/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is best practice to always clean up gRPC resources such as client channels, servers, and previously attached Contexts whenever they are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is even true for JUnit tests, because otherwise leaked resources may not only linger in your machine forever, but also interfere with subsequent tests. A not-so-bad case is that subsequent tests can&amp;rsquo;t pass because of a leaked resource from the previous test. The worst case is that some subsequent tests pass that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have passed at all if the previously passed test had not leaked a resource.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/kotlin-gradle-projects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that gRPC Java now has out of box support for Kotlin projects built with Gradle? &lt;a href=&#34;https://kotlinlang.org/&#34;&gt;Kotlin&lt;/a&gt; is a modern, statically typed language developed by JetBrains that targets the JVM and Android. It is generally easy for Kotlin programs to interoperate with existing Java libraries. To improve this experience further, we have added support to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/google/protobuf-gradle-plugin/releases&#34;&gt;protobuf-gradle-plugin&lt;/a&gt; so that the generated Java libraries are automatically picked up by Kotlin. You can now add the protobuf-gradle-plugin to your Kotlin project, and use gRPC just like you would with a typical Java project.

The following examples show you how to configure a project for a JVM application and an Android application using Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How fast is gRPC?  Pretty fast if you understand how modern clients and servers are built.  In
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/optimizing-grpc-part-1&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, I showed how to get an easy &lt;strong&gt;60%&lt;/strong&gt; improvement.  In this

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A common question with gRPC is how to make it fast.  The gRPC library offers users access to high
performance RPCs, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t always clear how to achieve this.  Because this question is common
enough I thought I would try to show my thought process when tuning programs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the start of the new year, and almost the end of my first full year on the
gRPC-Go project, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to provide an update on
the state of gRPC-Go development and give some visibility into how we manage the
project.  For me, personally, this is the first open source project to which
I&amp;rsquo;ve meaningfully contributed, so this year has been a learning experience for
me.  Over this year, the team has made constant improvements to our work habits
and communication.  I still see room for improvement, but I believe we are in a
considerably better place than we were a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For past few months we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on improving gRPC-Go performance. This includes improving network utilization, optimizing CPU usage and memory allocations. Most of our recent effort has been focused around revamping gRPC-Go flow control. After several optimizations and new features we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to improve quite significantly, especially on high-latency networks. We expect users that are working with high-latency networks and large messages to see an order of magnitude performance gain.
Benchmark results at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog summarizes the work we have done so far (in chronological order) to improve performance and lays out our near-future plans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Announcing out of the box support for gRPC in the Flatbuffers serialization library.</title>
      <link>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/flatbuffers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/flatbuffers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent release of Flatbuffers &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/releases&#34;&gt;version 1.7&lt;/a&gt; introduced truly zero-copy support for gRPC out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/&#34;&gt;Flatbuffers&lt;/a&gt; is a serialization library that allows you to access serialized data without first unpacking it or allocating any
additional data structures. It was originally designed for games and other resource constrained applications, but is now finding more general use, both by teams within Google and in other companies such as Netflix and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/loadbalancing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post describes various load balancing scenarios seen when deploying gRPC. If you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/&#34;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt; with multiple backends, this document is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large scale gRPC deployment typically has a number of identical back-end instances, and a number of clients. Each server has a certain capacity. Load balancing is used for distributing the load from clients optimally across available servers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our guest post today comes from Brian Hardock, a software engineer from Deis working on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://helm.sh/&#34;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. Helm provides its users with a customizable mechanism for
managing distributed applications and controlling their deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have the good fortune to be a member of the phenomenal open-source Kubernetes Helm community serving as
a core contributor. My first day working with the Helm team was spent prototyping the architecture for
the next generation of Helm. By the end of that day, we had procured the preliminary RPC protocol data model
used to enable communication between Helm and its in-cluster server component, Tiller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally a part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/yik-yak-eng&#34;&gt;Yik Yak Engineering Blog&lt;/a&gt; which focused on sharing the lessons learned as we evolved Yik Yak from early-stage startup code running in Amazon Web Services to an eventual incremental rewrite, re-architecture, and live-migration to Google Cloud Platform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our previous blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/yik-yak-eng/migration-to-google-cloud-platform-overview-9b5e5c17c368&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; we gave an overview of our migration to Google Cloud Platform from Amazon Web Services. In this post we will drill down into the role that &lt;a href=&#34;https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/&#34;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway&#34;&gt;grpc-gateway&lt;/a&gt; played in that migration and share some lessons which we picked up along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/&#34;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt; makes it easier to build high-performance
microservices by providing generated service entrypoints in a variety
of different languages.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://bazel.io&#34;&gt;Bazel&lt;/a&gt; complements these
efforts with a capable and fast polyglot build environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pubref/rules_protobuf&#34;&gt;rules_protobuf&lt;/a&gt; extends

      <description>Our guest post today comes from Dale Hopkins, CTO of Vendasta.
Vendasta started out 8 years ago as a point solution provider of products for small business. From the beginning we partnered with media companies and agencies who have armies of salespeople and existing relationships with those businesses to sell our software. It is estimated that over 30 million small businesses exist in the United States alone, so scalability of our SaaS solution was considered one of our top concerns from the beginning and it was the reason we started with Google App Engine and Datastore.</description>

      <description>Today, the gRPC project has reached a significant milestone with its 1.0 release. Languages moving to 1.0 include C++, Java, Go, Node, Ruby, Python and C# across Linux, Windows, and Mac. Objective-C and Android Java support on iOS and Android is also moving to 1.0. The 1.0 release means that the core protocol and API surface are now stable with measured performance, stress tested and developers can rely on these APIs and deploy in production, they will follow semantic versioning from here.</description>

      <title>gRPC with REST and Open APIs</title>
      <link>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/coreos/</link>

      <guid>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/coreos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our guest post today comes from Brandon Phillips of &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreos.com/&#34;&gt;CoreOS&lt;/a&gt;. CoreOS builds open source projects and products for Linux Containers. Their flagship product for consensus and discovery &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreos.com/etcd/&#34;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt; and their container engine &lt;a href=&#34;https://coreos.com/rkt/&#34;&gt;rkt&lt;/a&gt; are early adopters of gRPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key reasons CoreOS chose gRPC is because it uses HTTP/2, enabling applications to present both a HTTP 1.1 REST/JSON API and an efficient gRPC interface on a single TCP port (available for Go). This provides developers with compatibility with the REST web ecosystem, while advancing a new, high-efficiency RPC protocol. With the recent release of Go 1.6, Go ships with a stable &lt;code&gt;net/http2&lt;/code&gt; package by default.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>gRPC - now with easy installation.</title>
      <link>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/installation/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/installation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we are happy to provide an update that significantly simplifies the getting started experience for gRPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most languages, &lt;strong&gt;the gRPC runtime can now be installed in a single step via native package managers&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt; for Node.js, &lt;code&gt;gem&lt;/code&gt; for Ruby and &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; for Python. Even though our Node, Ruby and Python runtimes are wrapped on gRPC&amp;rsquo;s C core, users now don&amp;rsquo;t need to explicitly pre-install the C core library as a package in most Linux distributions. We autofetch it for you :-).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Java, we have simplified the steps needed to add gRPC support to your build tools&lt;/strong&gt; by providing plugins for Maven and Gradle. These let you easily depend on the core runtime to deploy or ship generated libraries into production environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use our Dockerfiles to use these updated packages - deploying microservices built on gRPC should now be a very simple experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Google Cloud PubSub - with the power of gRPC!</title>
      <link>https://cjyabraham.github.io/grpc/blog/pubsub/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/&#34;&gt;Google Cloud PubSub&lt;/a&gt; is Google&amp;rsquo;s scalable real-time messaging service that lets users send and receive messages between independent applications. It&amp;rsquo;s an important part of Google Cloud Platform&amp;rsquo;s big data offering, and is used by customers worldwide to build their own robust, global services. However, until now, the only way to use the Cloud PubSub API was via JSON over HTTP. That&amp;rsquo;s all changed with the release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2016/03/announcing-grpc-alpha-for-google-cloud-pubsub&#34;&gt;PubSub gRPC alpha&lt;/a&gt;. Now &lt;strong&gt;users can access PubSub via gRPC&lt;/strong&gt; and benefit from all the advantages it brings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The gRPC team is excited to announce the immediate availability of gRPC Beta. This release marks an important point in API stability and going forward most API changes are expected to be additive in nature. This milestone opens the door for gRPC use in production environments.   We’re also taking a big step forward in improving the installation process. Over the past few weeks we’ve rolled out gRPC packages to Debian Stable/Backports.</description>

      <description>Motivation Google has been using a single general-purpose RPC infrastructure called Stubby to connect the large number of microservices running within and across our data centers for over a decade. Our internal systems have long embraced the microservice architecture gaining popularity today. Having a uniform, cross-platform RPC infrastructure has allowed for the rollout of fleet-wide improvements in efficiency, security, reliability and behavioral analysis critical to supporting the incredible growth seen in that period.</description>

      <description>This document introduces you to gRPC and protocol buffers. gRPC can use protocol buffers as both its Interface Definition Language (IDL) and as its underlying message interchange format. If you’re new to gRPC and/or protocol buffers, read this! If you just want to dive in and see gRPC in action first, see our Quick Starts.
 Overview In gRPC a client application can directly call methods on a server application on a different machine as if it was a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services.</description>
