<p>If you have ever wanted to run an event around <a href="http://grpc.io">gRPC</a>, but didn&rsquo;t know where to start, or wasn&rsquo;t sure what content is available - we have released the <a href="https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/meetup-kit">gRPC Meetup Kit</a>!</p>

<p>The meetup kit includes a 15 minute presentation on the basic concepts of gRPC, with accompanying <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dgI09a-_4dwBMLyqfwchvS6iXtbcISQPLAXL6gSYOcc/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVsIfSfS6I4">video</a> for either reference or playback, as well as a <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-grpc/index.html">45 minute codelab</a> that takes you through the basics of gRPC in <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. At the end of the codelab participants will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of gRPC.</p>
